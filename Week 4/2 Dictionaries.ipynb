    "\n",
    "We have learned a number of data types that are sequences of values: \n",
    "\n",
    "- __str__: Strings, which are sequences of characters.\n",
    "- __list__: Lists, which are mutable sequences of values.\n",
    "- __tuple__: Tuples, which are immutable sequences of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these data types that are sequences, to access a single element, we can use an __index__, which is an integer indicating the position of the element to be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce another data type called __dictionary__ (```dict``` in Python). Dictionaries are another kind of compound type to store a collection of elements. However, instead of storing a __sequence__ of elements, dictionaries are used to store __mappings__ from __keys__ to __values__.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this concept, think about the name __dictionary__. What is a dictionary? What do you use a dictionary for?\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"dictionary\" is essentially a book that stores __mappings__ from words to their definitions. When we use an English dictionary such as the Webster's Dictionary, for example, do we usually read it __sequentially__ as if it were a fiction? No! Instead, we use it for __lookup__, i.e., we use it to look up the definition of a particular word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in Python a dictionary is also used for __lookup__. A dictionary in Python stores mappings between keys (analogous to words in a real dictionary) and values (analogous to definitions of words in a real dictionary). When we use a dictionary in Python, we usually use it to quickly look up the value of a particular key."
